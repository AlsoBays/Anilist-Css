# Bays' AniList CSS

This is where i'll store alll the code I ever used for my [AniList Profile](https://anilist.co/user/Bays).

If you need any help with anything or have any questions, you can contact me on my other socials found on my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/AlsoBays), but I most frequently use [my discord](https://discordid.netlify.app/?id=734882428900081685) and you'll get a way faster respnse there than anything else.

Obviously the layouts will get better as I get better at understanding it. 
Always been somewhat Interested in code and shit like that, 
but I'm still learning. I use references, steal the codes, and try to make 
them into my own using what I know. Css is confusing as hell.
